Then demonstrate this learning through consistent behavior change. Special one-on-one time with each child, even just 10-15 minutes of their chosen activity with your full attention, can help rebuild security. Most importantly, children are remarkably responsive to genuine change—as they see you managing your emotions differently, their sense of safety will gradually restore.

It sounds counterintuitive, but trying to suppress or fight intrusive thoughts often makes them more persistent. Instead, therapy helps you develop a new relationship with these thoughts where they become less threatening and gradually lose their power. A therapist who specializes in OCD can help you gradually face situations that trigger these thoughts (like cooking or taking the subway) while learning not to engage in avoidance or mental rituals. Many people find significant relief through this approach. Would you like some guidance on how to find a therapist who specializes in these issues?"

To find a therapist who specializes in intrusive thoughts and OCD, I'd recommend starting with the International OCD Foundation (IOCDF) website, which has a therapist directory specifically for finding professionals trained in ERP and experienced with intrusive thoughts. Psychology Today's therapist finder also lets you filter for OCD specialists. When reaching out, you can specifically ask if they have experience treating unwanted intrusive thoughts or \"harm OCD.\" Many therapists offer brief consultation calls where you can ask about their experience with these issues before committing to an appointment. If cost is a concern, you might look into university training clinics or therapists who offer sliding scale fees. Would you like me to explain more about what to expect in your first appointment or how to prepare for it?"

Your concern is completely valid. It's particularly worrying when someone becomes less responsive or isolated, as these can indicate deepening depression. As her friend, you're in a position to provide crucial support during this difficult time. Have you been able to have any direct conversations with her about your concerns for her mental health?"

For your next conversation, it might be helpful to approach it differently. Rather than suggesting therapy directly, you might share your specific observations without judgment: \"I've noticed you seem more tired lately and haven't been doing things you used to enjoy.\" Then express how you feel: \"I miss the times we used to spend together and I'm concerned because I care about you.\" Would an approach like this feel comfortable for you?"

This helps reduce isolation, which is particularly important with depression. You might also suggest activities that don't explicitly mention mental health but could help—like going for a short walk together, helping with practical tasks if her energy is low, or even just sitting together watching a movie. If you're concerned about immediate safety—if she expresses thoughts of harming herself or suicide—that would warrant contacting emergency services.

For warning signs that might indicate a more urgent situation, watch for: any talk of death, suicide, or not wanting to be here anymore; giving away possessions; sudden calmness after a period of distress (which can sometimes indicate a person has made a decision about suicide); increased substance use; extremely risky behavior; or saying goodbye in ways that seem final. If you notice these signs, it's appropriate to ask directly if she's thinking about suicide. Contrary to common belief, asking this question doesn't plant the idea—rather, it can provide relief that someone noticed their pain. If she indicates she's having suicidal thoughts, staying with her and connecting her with crisis resources like the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline becomes crucial. Remember though, while supporting your friend is important, it's also essential to maintain your own wellbeing. Do you have support for yourself during this difficult time?"

It must feel particularly defeating to feel that even your therapist has given up.

That ongoing trauma response isn't something that simple interventions can address, and the isolation of feeling that no one truly understands your experience adds another layer of burden. The exhaustion of living with this level of trauma for 30 years while simultaneously trying to function and maintain relationships would be immense. While I won't pretend to fully understand your specific experience, I do recognize that trauma of this severity often requires more specialized and intensive approaches than what you've been offered.

That's not resistance; it's your nervous system protecting you from being overwhelmed. It's particularly frustrating that when you found something potentially helpful with Somatic Experiencing, insurance barriers got in the way. The reality that access to proper trauma treatment often depends on financial resources adds another layer of injustice to your situation. The most appropriate care being placed out of reach due to cost creates a system where healing becomes a privilege rather than a right. This financial barrier is a reality for many trauma survivors and represents a serious failure of our mental health systems. Given these constraints, I wonder if there might be any trauma-informed resources that could be accessible to you, such as sliding-scale specialists, trauma recovery grants, or community programs focused on complex trauma? Would it be helpful to explore what might be available within your current constraints?"
