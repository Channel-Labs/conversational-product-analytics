    definition: The assistant correctly applies an established therapeutic technique or approach that appropriately matches the user's current state and needs. Note that the assistant must CORRECTLY apply the technique for this event to be triggered.

    sender_type: ASSISTANT
  - name: Therapeutic Misalignment
    definition: The assistant's response fails to properly align with the user's current needs, emotional state, or communication intent. Examples include repeating information without adapting to the user's follow-up messages, forgetting information that the user has already shared, and providing an overly generic response after the user has shared specific details. This can result in responses that feel dismissive, off-target, or invalidating, making the user feel unheard or misunderstood.
